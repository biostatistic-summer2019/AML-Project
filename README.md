# Background
Leukemia is a cancer of the blood arising in white blood cells of the bone marrow. It poses a substantial population burden as the most common pediatric cancer ([Steliarova-Foucher et al 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410997); [SEER data](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/amyl.html)). Acute Myelogenous Leukemeia (AML) is a type of leukemia impacting the myeloblast stem cells. AML arises at a current rate of approximately 20,000 cases per year, with 27.4% 5-year survival 2. It is a molecularly heterogeneous cancer, with several clinically relevant subtypes, including perhaps dozens of subtypes defined by factors ranging from cell differentiation state to cytogenic and sequencing assays ([Yi G. et al 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124718320588?via%3Dihub); [Tyner J. W. et al 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0623-z)). Pediatric AML is characterized at a molecular level by rare somatic mutations, absence of common adult AML mutations, and relatively frequent structural variants ([Bolouri H et al 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4439)).
